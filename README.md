# Oldplay

Text mode music player for esoteric (8/16-bit computers and consoles etc) and
contemporary (only MP3 atm :) music formats.

For MacOS / Linux (like, who uses the terminal on Windows anyway?).

Scans all files & dirs provided on the command line and lets you search from
within the app (just type and press Enter).

Nice rainbow textmode musix bars
